# JavaScript Earthquake Analysis
Module 15

## Project Description

Develop a way to visualise USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organisations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

### Instructions

1. Visit the USGS Geo.JSON feed *https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php* and choose a dataset to visualise.

2. Click on your chosen dataset and use the given URL to pull in the data for your visullisation.

3. Import and visualise the data by doing the following

* Using Leaflet, create a map that plots all the earthquake from the chosen dataset based on longitude and latitude.

* Add data markers that reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by colour. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear darker in colour.

* Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its marker is clicked.

* Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.

### Dependencies

* JavaScript
